# Segment-Anything-MetaAI-SAM: Automatic Mask Generator and Predictor

This repository implements Meta AI's Segment Anything Model (SAM) for enhanced image segmentation and prediction. It features an Automatic Mask Generator and a Predictor with SAM for improved accuracy in segmentation and feature-based tasks.

## Technology Used

This repository utilizes advanced deep learning techniques for automatic image segmentation and prediction. The Automatic Mask Generator uses computer vision to automatically generate masks for images, and the Predictor with SAM employs the Self-Attention Mechanism (SAM) to improve prediction accuracy for various tasks.

## Functionality
Automatic Mask Generator: Automatically generates masks from input images, useful for tasks like image segmentation. The process uses computer vision algorithms to detect and separate regions of interest in an image.

##Predictor with SAM: 
Enhances predictions using the Self-Attention Mechanism (SAM), allowing the model to focus on important features of the input data, improving accuracy for tasks such as classification or time-series forecasting.

## How It Works
Automatic Mask Generator: The model preprocesses images and generates masks based on learned features, which can be used for further analysis.

## Predictor with SAM: 
The model applies SAM to analyze input data and produce predictions by focusing on the most relevant features, capturing complex relationships between data points.

## Setup and Installation
To run the notebooks, you will need to install dependencies like PyTorch, Torchvision, and OpenCV. You can install them 

## Code Explanation
Automatic Mask Generator
### Image Preprocessing: The notebook preprocesses the input image to normalize and resize it before passing it to the model.

### Model Architecture: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract features from the image and generate the mask based on these features.

### Predictor with SAM Self-Attention Mechanism: SAM allows the model to focus on relevant input features, enhancing its ability to make accurate predictions.

### Model Architecture: SAM layers weigh input features differently, allowing the model to process complex relationships and improve prediction accuracy.
